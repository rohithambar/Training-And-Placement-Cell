  JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
  EMAIL_USER=your_gmail_address@gmail.com

### 8. **Default Credentials (if any)**

#### Creating an Admin Account

Currently, there is no interface to create an admin account. To create one, follow these steps:

1. Make sure your backend dependencies are installed (`npm install` in the `backend` folder).
2. In the `backend` directory, locate the `createAdmin.js` script.
3. Run the script using Node.js:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    node createAdmin.js
    ```

4. Follow any prompts or instructions in the terminal to set up the admin account.

After running the script, you can log in with the admin credentials you provided.

### 9. **Troubleshooting**

- Make sure MongoDB is running.
- If you get CORS errors, check your backend CORS configuration.
- For email features, ensure you use a Gmail App Password (not your regular Gmail password).

---

### 10. **Build for Production**

To create a production build of the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```
